@article{Jiang12a,
  abstract      = {We describe a numerical algorithm to integrate the equations of radiation magnetohydrodynamics in multidimensions using Godunov methods. This algorithm solves the radiation moment equations in the mixed frame, without invoking any diffusion-like approximations. The moment equations are closed using a variable Eddington tensor whose components are calculated from a formal solution of the transfer equation at a large number of angles using the method of short characteristics. We use a comprehensive test suite to verify the algorithm, including convergence tests of radiation-modified linear acoustic and magnetosonic waves, the structure of radiation-modified shocks, and two-dimensional tests of photon bubble instability and the ablation of dense clouds by an intense radiation field. These tests cover a very wide range of regimes, including both optically thick and thin flows, and ratios of the radiation to gas pressure of at least 10-4-104. Across most of the parameter space, we find that the method is accurate. However, the tests also reveal there are regimes where the method needs improvement, for example when both the radiation pressure and absorption opacity are very large. We suggest modifications to the algorithm that will improve the accuracy in this case. We discuss the advantages of this method over those based on flux-limited diffusion. In particular, we find that the method is not only substantially more accurate, but often no more expensive than the diffusion approximation for our intended applications.},

@article{Tsang15a,
  abstract      = {Radiation pressure can be dynamically important in star-forming environments such as ultra-luminous infrared and submillimetre galaxies. Whether and how radiation drives turbulence and bulk outflows in star formation sites is still unclear. The uncertainty in part reflects the limitations of direct numerical schemes that are currently used to simulate radiation transfer and radiation-gas coupling. An idealized setup in which radiation is introduced at the base of a dusty atmosphere in a gravitational field has recently become the standard test for radiation-hydrodynamics methods in the context of star formation. To a series of treatments featuring the flux-limited diffusion approximation as well as a short-characteristics tracing and M1 closure for the variable Eddington tensor approximation, we here add another treatment that is based on the implicit Monte Carlo radiation transfer scheme. Consistent with all previous treatments, the atmosphere undergoes Rayleigh-Taylor instability and readjusts to a near-Eddington-limited state. We detect late-time net acceleration in which the turbulent velocity dispersion matches that reported previously with the short-characteristics-based radiation transport closure, the most accurate of the three preceding treatments. Our technical result demonstrates the importance of accurate radiation transfer in simulations of radiative feedback.},

  abstract      = {We present a method for simulating the evolution of H II regions driven by point sources of ionizing radiation in magnetohydrodynamic media, implemented in the three-dimensional Athena MHD code. We compare simulations using our algorithm to analytic solutions and show that the method passes rigorous tests of accuracy and convergence. The tests reveal several conditions that an ionizing radiation hydrodynamic code must satisfy to reproduce analytic solutions. As a demonstration of our new method, we present the first three-dimensional, global simulation of an H II region expanding into a magnetized gas. The simulation shows that magnetic fields suppress sweeping up of gas perpendicular to magnetic field lines, leading to small density contrasts and extremely weak shocks at the leading edge of the H II region's expanding shell.},

@article{VanLeer_1977,
  abstract      = {An approach to numerical convection is presented that exclusively yields upstream-centered schemes. It starts from a meshwise approximation of the initial-value distribution by simple basic functions, e.g., Legendre polynomials. In every mesh the integral of the distribution is conserved. The overall approximation need not be continuous. The approximate distribution is convected explicitly and then remapped meshwise in terms of the basic functions. The weights of the basic functions that approximate the initial values in a mesh may be determined by finite differencing, but the most accurate schemes are obtained by least-squares fitting. In the latter schemes, the weights of the basic functions must be regarded as independent state quantities and must be stored separately. Examples of second-order and third-order schemes are given, and the accuracy of these schemes is discussed. Several monotonicity algorithms, designed to prevent numerical oscillations, are indicated. Numerical examples are given of linear and nonlinear wave propagation, also regarding monotonicity.},

  abstract = {Benchmark solutions to nontrivial radiation transport problems are crucial to the validation of transport codes. This paper gives an analytical transport solution for non-equilibrium radiative transfer in an infinite and isotropically scattering medium. The radiation source in the medium is isotropic in angle and constant in time (but only exists in a finite period of time), and is allowed to be uniformly distributed in a finite space or to be located at a point. The solution is constructed by applying the Fourier transform with respect to spatial variable and the Laplace transform with respect to temporal variable. The integration over angular variable is treated exactly. The resulting solution, as a function of space and time and in the form of a double integral, is evaluated numerically without much difficulty. Tables and figures are given for the resulting benchmark solution.}

  title        = {Comparison of Direct Eulerian Godunov and Lagrange Plus Remap, Artificial Viscosity Schemes},
  author       = {Pember, R B and Anderson, R W},
  abstractnote = {The authors compare two algorithms for solving the equations of unsteady inviscid compressible flow in an Eulerian frame: a staggered grid, Lagrange plus remap artificial viscosity scheme and a cell-centered, direct Eulerian higher-order Godunov scheme. They use the two methods to compute solutions to a number of one- and two-dimensional problems. The results show the accuracy of the two schemes to be generally equivalent. In a 1984 survey paper by Woodward and Colella, the Lagrange plus remap approach did not compare favorably with the higher-order Godunov methodology. They examine, therefore, how certain features of the staggered grid scheme considered here contribute to its improved accuracy. The critical features are shown to be the use of a monotonic artificial viscosity in the Lagrange step and, in the remap step, the use of a corner transport upwind scheme with van Leer limiters in conjunction with separate advection of internal and kinetic energies.},
